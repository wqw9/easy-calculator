# easy calculator
Just an attempt.
To be honest,My current ability is limited to writing just over 500 lines of code.
I have tried defining functions and taking derivatives.
But you will find that it keeps displaying left parentheses and cannot be recognized.
I also use the printf method.I really can't find the problem.
I won't release that code, it's embarrassing.
